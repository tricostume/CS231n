Image Classification Pipeline

    Split training data into training set and validation set
    Preprocess the training set
        mean subtraction
        normalization
        PCA and Whitening
        apply preprocessing statistics (e.g. mean image) to all splits
    Weight Initialization
        small random numbers
        sqrt(2/n)
    Batch Normalization: insert the BatchNorm layer immediately after fully connected layers or convolutional layers.
    Regularization
        L2 regularization
        L1 regularization
        L1 + L2
        Max norm constraints
        Dropout/inverted dropout
        Common Choice: single, global L2 Regularization and dropout (p = 0.5)
    Train the model and evaluate the model on validation set
        Optimization
            Stochastic Gradient Descent
    Cross-Validation for hyperparameter tuning
        List all the hyperparameters.
        Grid Search
    Train the model with the optimal hyperparameter setting and make predictions on testing set.
